## Projects:

* **Food Forecasting Analysis** -	Helped a meal delivery company with demand forecasting so that the fulfilment centers in multiple cities can plan the stock of the raw materials accordingly. Tableau was used to analyze, manipulate, wrangle, and visualize the data. Business intelligent observations were presented using dashboards and storyboards.

* **@rate_dogs Twitter Handle** -	Data was gathered from the tweet archive of Twitter user @rate_dogs using Python Libraries, accessed their quality and tidiness and cleaned them using Python. Wrangling efforts were documented in Jupyter Notebook and showcased them using analysis and visualization. [refer](rate_dogs/wrangle_act.ipynb)

* **NYC Taxi Trip** - Data exploration on Taxi Trip Duration dataset for NYC was performed and basic ML models were used for predicting the trip durations using Python. [refer](NYC_Taxi_Trip/Project.ipynb)

* **Exploring Weather Trends** - A global temperature dataset was analyzed and cleaned using PostgreSQL, calculations were carried out, data visualizations were created using Excel, and findings were noted to compare local and global temperature trends. [refer](Exploring_Weather_Trends/Project.pdf)

* **Geospatial Analysis of Superstore** -	Geospatial analysis of the performance of a US-based Superstore was carried out in Tableau to make business intelligent observations and was presented in the form of dashboards and storyboards.
